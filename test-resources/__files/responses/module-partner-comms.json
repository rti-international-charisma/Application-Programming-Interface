This often happens when you feel attacked or criticized. It also involves pushing the blame onto the other person so that you don&rsquo;t take responsibility. The problem with this is it shows that you&rsquo;re not listening to your partner&rsquo;s complaint or taking them seriously.

This can also take the form of leaving in the middle of an argument. Remember it&rsquo;s okay to take a break from an argument if tension is high, but it&rsquo;s good to communicate about the break. This type of behavior can make your partner feel rejected or abandoned. <span class=\"s1\">What&rsquo;s an alternative:</span><span class=\"s2\"> If </span>you need time out to take a few deep breaths and collect your thoughts, let your partner know, and then return to the conversation when you&rsquo;re ready. This way, your partner will understand that you are taking care of yourself, not trying to reject them.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Happy couples still have disagreements, but they don&rsquo;t use dirty fighting, or they apologize quickly when they do.
