This way, your partner will understand that you are taking care of yourself, not trying to reject them.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Happy couples still have disagreements, but they don&rsquo;t use dirty fighting, or they apologize quickly when they do.

If you are unhappy about our relationship and your mind is straying to thoughts of other women, I would like us to talk about it in private.&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\">&ldquo;When you come home at night after the bar, I feel disappointed, because I would like to see more of you, and I would like some money for food for the children. I would like us to discuss how we can make things better together.&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li3\">These statements carry no blame and are phrased not to annoy the person we&rsquo;re talking to. The expectations within them are presented in a nonjudgmental manner (there is no &ldquo;you must...&rdquo;) and are not accusing the listener. They state your expectations or hopes, but they do not demand that they be met.</li>\n</ul>",
